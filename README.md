## Usage

Once the app is running, simply enter a city name to get the current weather details and a 5-day forecast. The background image will change to reflect the weather conditions (e.g., sunny, rainy, cloudy) and will also adjust based on whether it's day or night.

## UI Design

The user interface is designed with Figma, ensuring a clean and modern look. For icons, Phosphor React Icons are used, providing a consistent and appealing visual language across the app.

## API

We use the free version of the OpenWeather API to fetch all weather data. This includes:

- Current weather conditions
- 5-day weather forecast

Ensure to monitor the API usage limits as per the free tier restrictions.
